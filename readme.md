## Syllabus

In Fall 2020, we did some introductory lecture about deep learning. We will not upload the video.

## References

There are a number of great materials about deep learning in public.

I've searched a lot and choose the best from each one.

I tried to write the reference link on each notebook but there will be some modification due to this issue.

Here are some references I've checked the most.
